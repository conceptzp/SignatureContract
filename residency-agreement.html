    <h2>9. Grievances</h2>
    <p>Step 1 A resident or resident’s representative shall explain in writing the grievance to the manager.</p>
    <p>a. The written grievance will include the clause of the grievance and provide a suggested remedy. A grievance must be brought within 10 working days from the day the decision; service or lack of service was observed.</p>
    <p>b. The manager, either alone or in collaboration with the licensee (owner), if the two positions are distinct and separate, shall reach a decision and communicate it in writing to the resident or the resident’s representative within 10 working days of receipt of the written grievance.</p>
    <p>c. Every effort should be made to settle grievances at this stage.</p>
    <p>Step 2 If the resident or resident’s representative feel the decision of the manager and/or licensee is still unfair, the resident or the resident’s representative shall respond in writing within 10 working days, requesting reconsideration of the issue:</p>
    <p>a. The response should again offer suggestions on what would be considered a fair compromise of the situation.</p>
    <p>b. The manager shall then form a committee of three individuals including the manager, the individual who developed the service plan (if different from the manager) or a nurse and another individual affiliated with the facility i.e. resident, caregiver, volunteer, to meet together and review the grievance.</p>
    <p>c. The manager will make a written reply of the committee’s decision to the resident or the resident’s representative second written response within 10 working days.</p>
    <p>d. The resident or resident’s representative may choose to be present during the committee meeting to represent the case of the resident.</p>
    <p>Step 3 If the resident or resident’s representative still feel that the decision of management has not resolved the problems, he or she should seek outside counsel through the Arizona Department of Health Services office of Home and Community Based Licensure or through the DES Long Term Care Ombudsmen or any other persons or resident advocacy agencies.</p>
    <p>Any reply which is not appealed by the resident or the resident’s representative within the time allowed at each level shall be considered settled and binding on the part of the resident or resident’s representative and the facility.</p>

    <h2>10. Right of Entry</h2>
    <p>For safety and comfort, JOSHUA TREE SENIOR LIVING LLC’s staff persons are permitted to enter Resident’s room to perform basic housekeeping services, respond to emergencies, make repairs and improvements, and perform other management functions, as we deem necessary or advisable. In addition, because the facility is licensed under the Arizona assisted living laws, any duly authorized agent of the Department of Health Services may, upon stating the purpose of the visit, enter and inspect any licensed portion of the facility, including Resident’s room, without advance notice. JOSHUA TREE SENIOR LIVING LLC shall also have the right to show the room to prospective residents at any reasonable time during the thirty 30-day period prior to the termination date for this Agreement. Whenever feasible, staff will attempt to give Resident reasonable notice before entering their room.</p>

    <p>Upon admission, the resident and/or responsible party’s signing the Admission Agreement, Home Rules, Resident’s Rights, Evacuation Procedures Orientation, Current Internal Facility Requirements Information, and Current Phone Numbers of various social service agencies, indicate that the resident/responsible party have received, read, and understood all contractual material.</p>
    <p>I, the Resident/POA, read and understood this Residency Agreement thoroughly.</p>
    <p>I, the Resident/POA, have been given an opportunity to ask questions, which have been explained to my satisfaction.</p>
